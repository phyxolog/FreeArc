</span><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>FreeArc allows browsing disk and archive

lang=EN-US>Extract files from archives to disk</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As soon as FreeArc have started performing
some operation (compression, extracting&#8230;), you may send operation to
background by clicking on the <span class=ButtonChar><span style='background:
aqua'>Background</span></span> button and continue to work with FreeArc. You
may also switch to main FreeArc window by simply clicking on it or move
progress indicator window aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While one operation continues to execute,
you may run second, third&#8230; operations. They all will be placed into queue
and executed in just the same order as they were run. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>All text entries in program keep their
entry history. Input data are saved to the freearc.history file right at the OK
button press and restored when dialog is open again. As the result, input
history is never lost and is global for all running copies of FreeArc. The only
exceptions to this rule are passwords &#8211; they are saved only in RAM and
need to be reentered on each next program run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the upper part of file manager window
you will find a navigation bar. Here you can enter name of directory or archive
(or even directory inside archive) and then press Enter to go there directly.
In particular, it&#8217;s the only way to</span><span style='background:yellow'>
open archive directly from Internet</span><span lang=EN-US>. Input history of
this line automatically saves names of all the archives you ever browsed, in
addition you can add to history name of current directory (or directory inside
archive) by clicking </span><span class=ButtonChar><span style='background:
aqua'>Save</span></span><span lang=EN-US> button. This history is also saved to
freearc.history file and therefore is global, FreeArc rereads it on every
directory change and also when </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>Refresh</span></span><span lang=EN-US> button is
clicked. Due to this, you can imitate Drag&amp;Drop technology by running two FreeArc
copies simultaneously. In one copy you save current directory/archive using </span><span
class=ButtonChar><span style='background:aqua'>Save</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> button and then in other copy you can select saved path from the
navibar, Extract output path, or Add output archive comboboxes. In the same
manner, you can easily select in the navibar name of archive just created or
path where files were extracted.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Archive creation and adding new files to archive</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For compression, you should select files
and/or directories on disk (not inside another archive!) and click the </span><span
class=ButtonChar><span style='background:aqua'>Add</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> button. If nothing is selected &#8211; all the files and
directories in current directory will be compressed. The Compression dialog
will appear where you can select compression level (or enter custom compression
mode), encryption options and so on. You can hide whole sections of this dialog
and this will mean that appropriate group of settings will not be applied at
all. For example, Encryption section is hidden by default which means that
encryption will not be used. But as soon as you&#8217;ve open this section
&#8211; encryption is enabled, with all the settings you see. That means that
you can enter all your preferences only once and then just enable them where
required by opening appropriate sections of compression dialog &#8211; all the
settings, except for passwords, are even kept between FreeArc runs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Entry field for output archive name may
also include path inside the archive &#8211; this allows you to quickly
compress files exactly to the place required just by selecting appropriate
entry from the history.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Encryption</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although for such popular encryption
algorithms as AES, there are no any known weaknesses, small possibility still
exists that such weaknesses (i.e. the way to decrypt data without knowing
password) will be found in future. It&#8217;s the reason why FreeArc
additionally supports 3 another best-reputed encryption algorithms
&#8211;Serpent</span>, <span lang=EN-US>Twofish and Blowfish</span>,<span
lang=EN-US> and even allows encrypting data by several algorithms sequentially
(i.e. to encrypt output of first algorithm by second one and so on). File
encrypted by several algorithms may be &#8220;cracked&#8221; only if weaknesses
will be found in every algorithm involved. Moreover FreeArc allows to raise
security strength by increasing number of rounds performed, using say
&#8220;aes:r100&#8221; as Encryption algorithm specification. Of course, both
methods of increasing encryption security decreases its speed, but you may not
worry too much taking into account that single algorithm with standard settings
process 20mb/s even on </span>1Ghz CPU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Next, key size in AES, Serpent and Twofish
&#8211; up to 256 bits, and in Blowfish it is up to 448 bits. This means that
for full utilization of security level that AES provides, you need to enter
password of ~50 random chars, or about 200-300 chars of meaningful text. Are
you really using passwords of such length? </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span lang=EN-US> So, in order to really
provide AES security level, FreeArc supports use of keyfiles &#8211; it&#8217;s
actually large passwords written to external file. The button </span><span
class=ButtonChar><span style='background:aqua'>Create</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> generates 1 kb of cryptographically strong random data and saves
them into the file you&#8217;ve specified. With encryption using keyfiles, your
data are protected from any &#8220;password crackers&#8221; which just
enumerate short passwords or words from dictionary &#8211; such technique
can&#8217;t be used to fit a 1kb of cryptographically strong random password.
The only way that remains to crack your encryption is to check all the 2^256
possible keys, or to find weakness in encryption algorithm used (all the
algorithms if several are used). Good luck! </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span lang=EN-US> You may use password
and keyfile together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course, you should keep keyfiles in
highly secure place. One possible solution may be to use flash keys which
supports physical protection (by means of scanning fingerprint or smth like
this).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Also I recommend you to enable encryption
of archive directories &#8211; this prevents intruder from knowing even names
of files in the archive. You can easily browse contents of archives with
encrypted directories/contents as soon as you&#8217;ve entered all the
passwords and keyfiles required to decrypt them into the Decryption section.
You can fill all these data in the Settings dialog box &#8211; of course,
passwords need to be reentered every time you restart FreeArc.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Decryption</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Passwords and keyfiles, specified in this
section, will be used only for decryption purposes. If you want to use the same
password/keyfile both for encryption and decryption &#8211; you need to specify
it both in Encryption and Decryption sections. Because Decryption settings are
saved to disk (except for passwords which are kept until FreeArc exit), you may
enter in this section (in the Settings dialog) all the passwords/keyfiles that
may be used in your archives and forget about any decryption problems until
next program run. Even when this section is closed (hidden), these
passwords/keyfiles are still used for decryption. So you will need to open this
section only in two cases &#8211; when you actually want to edit the settings and
when you need to decrypt archive using </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>Modify</span></span><span lang=EN-US> command (see
below).</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>Data protection</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Like RAR, FreeArc can recover archives,
broken due to errors in magnetic storage or during transmission, using Recovery
Record &#8211; special data appended to the archive. In this section you may
add RR, or delete it from existing archive, and even specify exact size of RR
that should be added. By default, program adds RR sized as about 1% of archive
size. You can specify exact RR size in percents or bytes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If you use &#8220;0%&#8221; setting, then
minimal Recovery Record is added, sufficient only for restoring archives over
Internet (or, to be exact, by copying from unbroken original), size of such
minimal RR is only 0.1% of archive size. Such setting is ideal for downloadable
archives &#8211; while it virtually doesn&#8217;t increase archive size, it
still allows recovering broken download by redownloading just the small amount
of 4kb sectors which were actually broken.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Modify archive</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Unlike other archivers, FreeArc is able to
change everything in existing archive &#8211; from compression level to
encryption settings. To do it, you need to select one or more archives in the
file manager, or enter into archive, and click the </span><span
class=ButtonChar><span style='background:aqua'>Modify</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> button. As usual, in order to enable some group of settings, you
should unfold the appropriate section in dialog. If you need to recompress
archive data &#8211; unfold </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>Compression</span></span><span lang=EN-US> section and
select here compression algorithm you want to apply. If you need to encrypt or
decrypt data &#8211; unfold the </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>Encryption</span></span><span lang=EN-US> or </span><span
class=ButtonChar><span style='background:aqua'>Decryption</span></span><span
lang=EN-US> section, appropriately. If you need to reencrypt archive &#8211;
unfold both sections and enter old password/keyfile into Decryption section and
new ones &#8211; into Encryption section. And so on. Please note that at this
moment recompression without reencryption and reencryption without recompression
aren&#8217;t possible (former due to fundamental laws, and later is just a
technical limitation of current program version).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If several archives were selected before
performing the operations &#8211; all them will be recompressed, reencrypted
and so on. If no files were selected, then FreeArc will process all the
archives in current directory.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Joining archives together</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>FreeArc is also able to join several
archives together &#8211; and does it much faster than decompressing and then compressing
the data again. In this operation, duplicates (i.e. files with repeated names
are automatically excluded from resulting archive). If files are added to
existing archive then new files will have higher priority (i.e. we update files
in old archive with new ones). In order to perform this operation, you need to
select archives to join in the file manager and select </span><span
class=ButtonChar><span style='background:aqua'>Join</span></span> <span
lang=EN-US>operation from the </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>File</span></span><span lang=EN-US> menu. If no files
are selected, then all archives in current directory will be joined.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Obtaining archive information/statistics </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>ArcInfo</span></span><span lang=EN-US> command shows
information about current archive. Ask me if you don&#8217;t understand some
fields here </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span
lang=EN-US>. Pay a special attention to the </span><span class=ButtonChar><span
style='background:aqua'>Decompression memory</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>field,
which shows how much RAM will be used for decompression process. If it&#8217;s
greater that &frac34; of your total RAM size &#8211; this archive can&#8217;t
be decompressed on your computer.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>File deletion</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>FreeArc is able to delete files and
directories from archives and files from disk. Deletion from archive is one
more archive operation which is also queued and performed in order (its
execution may be lengthy because it may need to recompress data in solid blocks
where only part of files was deleted), but FreeArc is so smart that it
&#8220;looks into the future&#8221; and immediately removes from the screen
names of files/directories that will be deleted.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Testing archives </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Queues testing of current archive, or
selected files in current archive (if any files are selected), or all archives
in the current directory, or archives selected.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>Archives extraction</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rules of selection of files/archives to
extract are just the same as for testing command.</span></p>
